# Sand Simulation v3

A remake of my earlier project (https://github.com/Sw1ndlers/SandSimulation)  
This is version 3 as version 2 was abandoned   

This remake includes
1. Much better system for handling blocks (all within the `Block` trait)
2. Better system for handling positions
3. Much better peformance than before

## Todo

- [ ] Implement a different system to update blocks
- [ ] Improve peformance
- [ ] Add different blocks (eg. Water)

## Keybinds

- 1 - Switch to Sand
- 2 - Switch to Rock
- 3 - Switch to Erase Tool
